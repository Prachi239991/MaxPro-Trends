Drug-eluting balloon (DEB) catheters are primarily used in the treatment of these conditions, where they offer targeted drug delivery directly to the site of arterial narrowing or blockage. In coronary artery interventions, DEB catheters help in reducing restenosis rates by releasing anti-proliferative drugs that inhibit the growth of neointimal tissue. This application is crucial for patients with complex coronary lesions and those who have a high risk of restenosis after conventional angioplasty. The demand for DEB catheters in coronary procedures is expected to grow as healthcare providers aim to enhance patient outcomes and reduce the need for repeat interventions.</p><p>In addition to coronary applications, drug-eluting balloon catheters are increasingly utilized in the treatment of peripheral artery disease. PAD affects the arteries outside the heart, often leading to significant complications if left untreated. DEB catheters in PAD applications help in addressing the challenges associated with vascular lesions in the lower limbs. By delivering drugs that prevent the excessive growth of scar tissue and promote healthy healing, DEBs offer a promising solution for managing complex peripheral lesions. The expansion of DEB usage in PAD reflects the growing awareness of the benefits of targeted drug delivery in improving long-term vascular health and reducing the incidence of limb-threatening complications.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=634358&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=258</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Drug-Eluting Balloon Catheters Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>B.
